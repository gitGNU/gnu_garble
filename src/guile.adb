package body Guile is

   --  The Pack and Unpack functions as defined by the Guile library
   --  are actually macros implementing pointer-to-integer conversion
   --  from SCM types (a pointer to a struct with a single char as its
   --  only member) to scm_t_bits types (which are actually uintptr_t
   --  types, integers guaranteed to be the same size as pointers).
   --
   --  The mechanism by which this conversion takes place, and what it
   --  actually means for our code, should not be our concern.  Thus,
   --  we will take advantages of the facilities provided by the
   --  System package and simply do address-to-integer conversions and
   --  vice-versa in an attempt to avoid the needfully complex ways
   --  that C programmers implement type-checking.

   function Pack (X : SCM_Bits) return SCM is
   begin
      --  Put X in a SCM record
      return SCM (To_Address (X));
   end Pack;

   function Unpack (X : SCM) return SCM_Bits is
   begin
      --  Pull X from its structure
      return SCM_Bits (To_Integer (S.Address (X)));
   end Unpack;

end Guile;
